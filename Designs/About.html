            Defogging is a process that aims to enhance the visibility and
            clarity of images captured in foggy or hazy conditions. In this
            brief text, I will explain how defogging works using a
            self-implemented AI model that combines a CNN (Convolutional Neural
            Network) and a histogram distribution technique for image
            clarification.<br />
            The first step in the defogging process is to analyze the input
            image using a CNN model. The CNN is trained on a large dataset of
            foggy and clear images to learn the patterns and characteristics of
            foggy scenes. By utilizing convolutional layers, the model can
            extract relevant features from the input image and understand the
            underlying foggy structure.<br />
            Once the CNN has processed the image, it generates a foggy map that
            represents the fog distribution across the scene. The foggy map
            highlights the areas where fog is most prevalent, helping the model
            identify regions that require clarification.<br />
            To further enhance the image clarity, a histogram distribution
            technique is employed. The histogram of the foggy image is analyzed
            to determine the fog density distribution. This distribution
            information is then used to estimate the original scene radiance, as
            fog tends to reduce the visibility by attenuating light. By modeling
            the fog density and its effects, the algorithm can estimate the
            radiance of the original scene. <br />
            Next, the estimated radiance is combined with the foggy map
            generated by the CNN. This fusion process involves subtracting the
            foggy map from the estimated radiance to recover the original scene
            radiance. The result is an image with reduced fog and improved
            visibility. <br />
            Finally, post-processing techniques such as contrast adjustment and
            noise reduction may be applied to further enhance the defogged
            image&#x27;s quality and clarity.<br />
            By leveraging the power of a CNN model to analyze foggy scenes and
            combining it with a histogram distribution technique for image
            clarification, the self-implemented AI model can effectively remove
            fog and improve visibility in images captured under adverse weather
            conditions.
