This is the model in which the fog gets reduced but red turns to yellow.

Potential solutions with this model:
1. Add the ingame test+training pictures wala dataset to our own created dataset, train for a 1000 epochs, and then run.
2. just put a filter for the yellow colour issue that we're getting (which i think was something sir had suggested)
3. suffer. (think of something else, tweak it with optimizers/loss functions which are more catered to colour)
